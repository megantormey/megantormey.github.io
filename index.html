          <h3>Hiking</h3>
          <p class="desc">I spent the summers of 2019 and 2020 working for the Appalachian Mountain Club in two of their
            high mountain huts (Greenleaf and Mizpah). My favorite activity in the summer is heading to the White
            Mountains to camp and explore the trails with my family and friends!</p>

          <p class="desc">I enjoy listening to podcasts while walking and driving! They are an entertaining
            and informative way to pass time. If you are looking for a podcast recommendation, I would highly recommend
            Armchair Expert.

          <h3>Oatmeal</h3>
          <p class="desc">Fun fact: I have eaten a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast practically every day for the last two
            years. It is so cozy and delicious, and it is so fun to try out different flavors and recipes!</p>
