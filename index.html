          <h3>Hiking</h3>
          <p>I spent the summers of 2019 and 2020 working for the Appalachian Mountain Club in two of their high
            mountain huts (Greenleaf and Mizpah). My favorite activity in the summers is to head up to the white
            mountains and explore the mountains and trails with my family and friends!</p>

          <h3>Podcasts</h3>
          <p>I spend a lot of time listening to podcasts while walking and driving! They are a wonderful and informative
            way to pass time. If you are looking for a podcast recommendation, I would highly recommend Armchair Expert.

          <h3>Oatmeal</h3>
          <p>I have eaten a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast practically every day for the last two years. It is so cozy
            and delicious, and it is so fun to try out different flavors and recipes!</p>
