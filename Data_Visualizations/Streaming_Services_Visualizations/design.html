  <h1>Data Visualization Comparing Streaming Services Over Time</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="sec_heading">Dataset Description</h2>
    <div class="contents">

      <p>This project aims to analyze at-home entertainment streaming in the United States across Netflix, Hulu, Prime
        Video, and Disney Plus. By visualizing this data, we derived meaningful insights on entertainment consumption
        trends
        and how the presence of streaming services impacts the entertainment we enjoy. To aid in this analysis, To aid
        us in
        our analysis of entertainment streaming in the US across time, we utilized two distinct datasets, “Movies on
        Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney+” and “TV Shows and Movies listed on Netflix,” both found on Kaggle. The
        first dataset is for Movies on Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney+, providing information on a collection of
        movies found on these streaming platforms. The salient variables in the “MoviesOnStreamingPlatforms” dataset
        include
        each movie's title, production year, IMDb rating, Rotten Tomatoes score, genre, and streaming service presence.
      </p>


      <p>The “MoviesOnStreamingPlatforms” dataset was broken down into a couple of new arrays to analyze which genres
        are
        present on streaming services across the decades. First, d3.filter() removed the movies not associated with any
        genre. Then, the next section of the data that I looked into was the year variable, and I filtered irrelevant
        points
        out of the data using a forEach loop and several if statements. With 28 different movie genres featured in the
        dataset, the fourteen most significant genres in the visualization were retained, while the irrelevant data
        points
        were filtered out using a forEach loop and if-statements. This created a new array of objects containing the
        genre
        breakdown of each decade's movies. When analyzing the correlation between IMDb ratings and Rotten Tomatoes
        percentages, data filtering removed movies that lacked rating values in those two categories, where Rotten
        Tomatoes
        and IMBd columns contained values with “NaN,” “undefined,” or nothing. Then, the values for these ratings were
        converted into numbers; where Rotten Tomatoes ratings were previously a string with a percentage, regex removed
        the
        percentage, and both ratings were turned from strings into numbers using Number().</p>

      <p>While it is interesting to congregate all streaming services to understand watch-from-home entertainment
        trends,
        another exciting facet of our research focused on arguably the most popular streaming service, Netflix. This
        second
        dataset, updated monthly, consists of the TV shows and movies available on Netflix from 2019 to 2021, with
        variables
        containing information on identifying a point as a movie or TV show, the date added on Netflix, and the actual
        release year. In the original dataset, we filtered out data that does not have values for the date added to
        Netflix,
        type, or title because that information is a necessary part of the graph. Then, we had to change the date added
        values from strings with the format “Month Day, Year” to be just the year represented as a number. Finally, we
        decided not to include data from 2021 because the rest of the data is for an entire year. To manipulate the
        dataset
        into improved usability, we reformatted the data into a dictionary list called yearToReleaseCountData. Each
        dictionary in the list has three key-value pairs representing a year, the total release count for that year, and
        the
        release count for movies that year. We looped through every data point in the dataset and checked its type and
        the
        year it was released on Netflix and updated the dictionary accordingly.</p>

    <h2 class="sec_heading">Design Rationale:</h2>
    <div class="contents">
      <h3>Graph 1:</h3>

      <p>The goal of the “Graph 1: Visualizing Movie Genres on Streaming Services Across their Production Decade”
        visualization is to show and compare how the relative popularity and inclusion of different genres on streaming
        services changes based on the decade in which the movie was released. In order to show this, I decided to use a
        line
        chart, with lines of different colors appearing on the chart representing the different genres. As the range of
        years that the data spans is so large, I found it more interesting to look at each decade as a whole rather than
        each individual year. This was achieved through the data filtering and reconfiguring described above.
        Additionally,
        I also decided to have the y axis represent the percentage of movies released in a genre in a decade, rather
        than
        the number. This allows for better comparison of the frequency of each genre in that decade compared to both
        other
        genres and other decades. Each of the data points in the graph is mapped from an array of objects I created from
        the
        original dataset. Each object contains the information for all of the decades for one of the analyzed genres.
        The
        main array holding all of these smaller objects is where the data is mapped from.</p>

      <p>This line chart visualization includes both marks and channels. The marks are the lines and data points on the
        graph. The data points show the comparison between the number of movies from a decade and the genre of these
        movies.
        The lines show the comparison between the comparative prevalence of each genre across the decades. In addition
        to
        the marks, there are also a few visual channels being employed on this graph. The first is horizontal and
        vertical
        position. These channels work together with the data points and lines to show the comparison to the users.
        FInally,
        color is also a visual channel on this graph. Each genre represented in the visualization is shown as a
        different
        color, further showing the comparison of the decades and percentages to the audience.</p>

      <h3>Graph 2:</h3>
      <p>Graph 2: Comparing Each Movies’ IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes Scores compares each movie’s IMDb Scores with their
        Rotten
        Tomatoes Scores, while illustrating the magnitude of their streaming service presence. Each data point is
        represented by the marks of this scatterplot, being the circles on the graph, which portray information through
        the
        channels horizontal and vertical aligned position and circle radius. A movie’s IMDb score is represented by
        their
        position on the x-axis, while their Rotten Tomatoes score is represented by their position on the y-axis.
        Another
        information facet mapped onto this visualization is the movies’ presence on the streaming platforms, represented
        by
        each circles’ radius. A movie present on one platform has a radius of 3px, while a movie on all four has a
        radius of
        12px.Plotting the movies scores against each other allowed us to compare the ratings of movies across two unique
        rating platforms. Both Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb are known as the most popular measurement of quality for movies
        and
        TV; however, by comparing their differing scores, we can evaluate how harsh, or lenient, the two measurement
        platforms are when evaluating movies.</p>

      <p>Additionally, the design decision to utilize radius in visualizing this graph was to aid us in understanding
        how
        one’s position in critic ratings might influence their presence on streaming platforms. By utilizing radius as
        another channel, we might be able to notice if the circles get larger and larger towards the top right corner,
        thus
        indicating that the higher rated movies are more likely to be on multiple streaming platforms. Lastly, opacity
        was
        used in this graph to allow for the visualization to illustrate the density of data points in certain areas
        through
        the resulting channel of density of circle clusters. While opacity was not an explicitly used channel, by
        setting
        each circle to an opacity of 0.3 allows us to see a more nuanced, detailed picture of movies’ ratings cluster
        themselves.</p>

      <h3>Graph 3:</h3>

      <p>Finally, The goal of Graph 3: Representing the Breakdown of TV Shows vs. Movies on Netflix across Time is to
        show
        how the trend of Netflix releases changed in 2020 compared to past years. Originally, the chart design was a
        line
        chart that would show the trend over time, but that would not be an interesting chart because it would only have
        one
        line representing the different totals of released content per year. So, I decided to do a bar chart because I
        could
        show the trends over time and include other information like what percentage of those releases are movies and TV
        shows. The other decision I had to make was whether to use percentages or actual numbers. My first idea was to
        use
        the number of released TV shows and released movies instead of showing the total number of releases. After
        discussing as a group, we decided that the data was better represented when the percentages were inside the bars
        and
        the total number was outside.</p>

      <p>With the reformatted data in yearToReleaseCountData that has data representing each year, release count, and
        movie
        release count, I created this chart. The graph has 14 bars representing each year from 2008 to 2020. Each bar
        has a
        red portion and a black portion. On the chart, there is a legend explaining that the red bar represents the
        percentage of the total releases that are movies and the black bar represents the percentage of that are TV
        shows.The four values I needed for each bar were the year, the percentage of TV shows released that year, the
        percentage of movies released, and the total number of releases. Using the information from
        yearToReleaseCountData,
        I calculated these values and added the information to the chart. The total release count values varied from 1
        to
        2153 so I used a log scale to visualize the differences. The left vertical axis shows the year that the bar to
        its
        right is representing. At the end of each bar, there is a number representing the total number of releases for
        that
        year. Then, inside the bar, there are percentages corresponding to the portion it is in. The channels are the
        red
        and black bars. The channels are varying the horizontal aligned length and vertical aligned position of the
        bars.

    <h2 class="sec_heading">The Story:</h2>
    <div class="contents">

      <p>These three graphs show us how streaming services have continued to gain popularity over the years and become a
        main source of entertainment. The viewers of these visualizations can see that streaming services are always
        releasing a variety of content with different genres and online ratings so that everyone can find something that
        they enjoy. Graph 1: Visualizing Movie Genres on Streaming Services Across their Production Decade shows us how
        genres from over the decades are represented on streaming services. The visualization shows us how some genres
        (such
        as thriller/horror and action/adventure) have decreased in relative presence, some genres (such as mystery/crime
        and
        sci-fi/fantasy) have had a constant and reasonably low relative presence, and how some genres (such as
        family/animation and more so documentary/biography) have increased in relative presence on streaming platforms
        over
        movies released through the decades from the 1970s to the present. These results are both interesting and
        surprising. One finding from the visualization that is especially so is the overwhelming relative presence of
        documentaries released in the 2000s that are on streaming services. This is not what I would have expected to be
        the
        most common movie genre in this decade, being nearly 20% more common than the next most prevalent genre, comedy
        and
        romance. Another finding that I find particularly surprising is the lack of presence of mystery and crime movies
        from any decade. I would have guessed mystery and crime movies to be much more popular on streaming services as
        this
        seems like it would be a very popular genre of movie.</p>

      <p>As a society, our preferences and opinions are always changing. We change what food we eat, what clothes we
        wear,
        where we want to live, etc. This is no different for what movies we want to watch. This visualization should
        give
        the viewer some insight into how our preferences for movie genres have changed over the decades. The world is
        now a
        very different place than it was in the 1970s, so it makes sense that the movies people were watching and
        creating
        in the seventies would be different than the movies we are watching and creating now.</p>


      <p>Graph 2: Comparing Each Movies’ IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes Scores illustrates a positive linear correlation
        between
        IMBd Scores and Rotten Tomatoes scores; as movies’ IMDb scores increase, their Rotten Tomatoes scores generally
        do
        as well. However, this visualization also is interesting in how it illustrates the ranges of scores for both
        platforms; IMDb seems more conservative, with most data points lying between 4.0 and 8.0, while Rotten Tomatoes
        scores distribute themselves pretty evenly across the 0 to 100 scale, with a decent number of 100’s awarded. If
        both
        platforms claim to be the best judgement of objective movie quality, one would expect them both to have similar
        movie scores. Surprisingly, this is not the case. Rotten Tomatoes utilizes the entire 0 to 100 rating scale,
        while
        IMDb seems to restrict its ratings into the ~4 to 8 range. Additionally, as shown by the darker, denser grouping
        of
        circles, there appears to be a cluster of circles situated between 80-100 on the Rotten Tomatoes scale and 6-8
        on
        the IMDb scores scale. This grouping can tell us that generally, IMDb rewards lower scores than Rotten Tomatoes,
        while IMDb rarely rewards scores above 9 or docks movies down to anything below a 4.</p>

      <p>One might also observe very defined horizontal rows across the graph at y = 40, 50, 60, 80, and 100. There
        seems to
        be a clustering of points at these values for Rotten Tomatoes scores due to the fact that they are whole
        numbers,
        and so when performing movie ratings, critics might be more inclined to round to the nearest ten -- a tactic
        that is
        perhaps unfairly subjective. Furthermore, there are no vertical lines of circles, IMBd might not round its
        ratings
        and is thus more objective than Rotten Tomatoes.</p>

      <p>Movie ratings have a huge influence on how we consume movies, or which movies are skyrocketed into success.
        This
        visualization illustrates a unique way to understand the two most prevalent movie ratings; through comparing the
        two
        movie rating moguls, IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, one can dive deeper into certain trends that occur in the sites’
        ratings. Rotten Tomatoes is more liberal in using the entire 0-100 scale, unafraid to reward higher ratings,
        including frequent 100%’s. IMDb constrains its ratings to a 4 to 8 bandwidth on the 0-10 scale, and sticks to
        generally lower scores than Rotten Tomatoes. Next time a movie viewer references the movie ratings given on
        these
        sites, it is in their best interest to contextualize each score in the respective sites’ typical rating behavior
        and
        how they compare.</p>

      <p>While movie ratings might have influenced what movies we saw in theaters, they might soon be more influential
        for
        which movies we see from our own homes, through streaming sites. However, it does not appear that movie ratings
        are
        yet to have a huge impact on streaming-site presence, as there is no appearance of prominent clusters or
        groupings
        of circles with larger radii. Even more, some of the movies with the lowest combined ratings are ones with
        larger
        radius, indicating a presence on more than one platform. As streaming platforms replace cable television or
        movie
        theatres in more and more households, we must be cautious of how movie ratings influence the entertainment
        options
        provided by these streaming platforms -- particularly after learning the inequalities between these sites’
        ratings.
