# Silcon Valley Diversity Visualization 

This project seeks to analyze the employee diversity in some of Silicon Valley’s top tech companies. Particularly in the past decade, the fair and equitable representation of all backgrounds and identities within some of the most influential companies in the world has been a significant concern.  By visualizing our two Silicon Valley employee race and gender datasets, we can truly uncover whether or not these tech companies are as diverse as they really ought to be. To aid us in our analysis, we derived meaningful insights on employee diversity at Silicon Valley’s top ten companies. These ten companies were selected by their presence in both the two datasets we used, as we wanted to be able to find ways to overlap the two datasets.  The datasets used in these visualizations are from https://github.com/cirlabs/Silicon-Valley-Diversity-Data and https://data.world/makeovermonday/2018w46.
