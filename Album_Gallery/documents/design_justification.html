  <h1>Album Gallery Design Process</h1>

  <h2>Describe of the gallery</h2>

  <p>The gallery will be about music, it will be a gallery of album covers.</p>

  <h2>Target Audience</h2>

  <p>The target audience for this site is people who are interested in music and album covers. People who are looking
    for new music to listen to, or who want to recommend their favorite albums to others and comment on them with tags.
  </p>

  <h2>Design Process</h2>

  <h3>Initial Gallery Page Sketches:</h3>

  <p>Gallery / Home Page Final Sketch:</p>
  <img class="sketch" src="gallerypageinitialsketch.JPG" />

  <p>Single image initial sketch:</p>

  <img class="sketch" src="singleimageinitialsketch.JPG" />

  <p>Tag page initial sketch:</p>

  <img class="sketch" src="tagpageinitialsketch.JPG" />

  <h3>Final Gallery Page Sketches:</h3>

  <p>Gallery / Home Page Final Sketch:</p>
  <img class="sketch" src="gallery_home_page_final.JPG" />

  <p>Image Details Page Final Sketch:</p>
  <img class="sketch" src="image_details_sketch_final.JPG" />

  <p>Tag Details Page Final Sketch:</p>
  <img class="sketch" src="tag_details_page_final.JPG" />"

  <p>I have chosen to organize the content as shown in the sketches because it makes all of the information very clear
    and
    easy for the target audience to find. Clicking on the images and tags to get to the details about that image or tag
    is
    a very simple and effective way for the target audience and users to be able to locate all of the information on the
    site, and quickly locate what specifically they are looking for. Additionally, including the link back to the
    gallery
    page from both the image details page and the tag details page is a clear way to navigate between all the pages of
    the
    site quickly and without depending on the back and forward button.</p>

  <h2>Leveraging Existing Design Patterns Throughout the Image Gallery</h2>

  <h3>Single Image View:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>One existing pattern is to have the image below and to the left of it. My site will follow this pattern by when
      a
      single album cover is displayed, the image will be on the left with the tags below it</li>
    <li>A "..." menu button in the corner of an image is single image view is a common design pattern where you click
      the
      button to access more functionalities</li>
    <li>My site has this "..." button on the corner of the image to open up the options for either adding a tag to the
      image, or deleting the image.</li>
    <li>This same style "..." button is also incorporated on the tag details page in a similar way</li>
    <li>Deleting an album cover from the collection is an option when clicking the "..." next to the image.
      Additionally, a
      common design pattern / practice is to have the initial delete button, followed by another confirmation that the
      user
      really wants to delete either the image or tag in reference.</li>
    <li>I have leveraged this design pattern in both the image details and tag details page where there is a delete
      button
      that initially appears after clicking the ... button, however after this a secondary confirmation button appears
      that
      must be clicked as well.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Gallery view:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>One convention of image galleries is that clicking on the image leads to more information. My site is consistent
      with that pattern.</li>
    <li>Having all of the images appear in a grid format is an existing design pattern for image galleries as the most
      user
      friendly means of viewing all of the images</li>
    <li>A common design pattern is having left facing arrow in the top left corner when on a details page as a way to
      return
      to the main gallery page</li>
    <li>I have leveraged this design pattern on my site where on both the image details page and the tag details page
      there
      is a left pointing arrow at the top (next to word instructions) where clicking links back to the gallery page.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Planning Requests, Type of Request and Required Parameters</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Request: add an image to gallery</li>

  <h2>Database Schema Design</h2>

  <h3>Plan:</h3>
  <p>
    ```
    albums (
    id: INTEGER {PK, U, Not, AI}
    file_name: TEXT
    file_ext: TEXT
    album_title: TEXT
    )

    tags (
    id: INTEGER {PK, U, Not, AI}
    tag: TEXT {U}
    )

    album_tags (
    id: INTEGER {PK, U, Not, AI}
    album_id: INTEGER
    tag_id: INTEGER
    )
    ```
  </p>


  <h2>Pseudocode Planning of Database Queries</h2>

  <h3>Display All Albums (gallery view):</h3>
  <p>
    ```
    SELECT * FROM albums
    ```
  </p>

  <h3>Search albums:</h3>
  <p>
    ```
    SELECT * FROM albums WHERE album_title LIKE search
    ```
  </p>

  <h3>Add albums:</h3>
  <p>
    ```
    INSERT INTO albums (file_name, file_ext, album_title) VALUES (file name, file extension, album title)
    ```
  </p>

  <h3>Add Tags:</h3>
  <p>
    ```
    INSERT INTO tags (tag) VALUES (tag)
    ```
  </p>

  <h3>Delete albums:</h3>
  <p>
    ```
    DELETE FROM albums WHERE album_title = "delete_input"
    ```
  </p>

  <h3>Delete tags:</h3>
  <p>
    ```
    DELETE FROM tags WHERE tag = "delete_input"
    ```
  </p>

  <h3>Display all tags:</h3>
  <p>
    ```
    SELECT * FROM tags
    ```
  </p>

  <h3>Display all tags from specific album:</h3>
  <p>
    ```
    SELECT tags.tag FROM tags INNER JOIN album_tags ON album_tags.tag_id = tags.id INNER JOIN albums ON
    album_tags.album_id = albums.id WHERE albums.album_title = 'specfic album_title"
    ```
  </p>

  <h3>Display all albums for a specific tag:</h3>
  <p>
    ```
    SELECT * FROM albums INNER JOIN album_tags ON album_tags.album_id = albums.id INNER JOIN tags ON album_tags.tag_id =
    tags.id WHERE tags.tag = 'specific tag'
    ```
  </p>


  <h2>PHP Pseudocode Planning</h2>

  <h3>Upload file:</h3>
  <p>
    ```
    if (submit post request sent) {

    filter inputs

    if (no upload error) {
    if(small enough file) {
    get current file name and extension
    } else
    message
    } else
    message

    insert new file into db

    change file name and path to be in upload / albums folder
    ```
  </p>
  <h3>all tags:</h3>
  <p>
    ```
    select all tags from table in db
    if(at least one tag) {
    foreach (tag) {
    create an array with the id value of each tag

    echo tag as query string param url
    }
    }
    ```
  </p>
  <h3>all images:</h3>
  <p>
    ```
    select all images and info from table in db

    if(at least one album) {
    foreach (album) {
    create an array with the id value of each album

    echo album as query string param url
    }
    }
    ```
  </p>

  <h3>add tag to album:</h3>
  <p>
    ```
    if (submit post request sent) {
    valid form true

    get image id

    filter inputs

    if (new tag and existing tag field both empty) {
    valid form false
    }

    if (valid form) {
    if (new tag)
    add tag to db
    add connection between tag and image to db
    } elseif (existing tag) {
    add connection between tag and image to db
    } else
    message

    }
    ```
  </p>

  <h3>delete album:</h3>
  <p>
    ```
    if(submit post request sent) {
    get image id

    delete album from albums table in db

    delete the image file

    delete the connection between album and any tags

    push message that it was successful
    }
    ```
  </p>

  <h3>remove tag form albums:</h3>
  <p>
    ```
    if (submit post request sent) {
    get tag id

    get id of albums that contain this tag

    delete connection between tag and albums from db

    push message of success
    }
    ```
  </p>
