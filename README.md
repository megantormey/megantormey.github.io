## Design Portfolio

My name is Megan Tormey.  I am a senior at Cornell University in the College of Engineering studying Information Science, Systems and Technology with concentrations in both Data Science and User Experience.  In addition, I am also pursuing a minor in Business.   I have featured here some of my projects including both interactive and non-interactive data visualizations, a PHP driven image gallery website, and a prototyping project that follows and highlights design decisions following the human centered design process.
