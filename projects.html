        <p class="description">These graphs are static data visualizations evaluating changes in streaming services and
          US streaming habits both over time and across platforms. The visualizations were created using d3 and from
          datasets gathered from https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney and
          https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-show.</p>

        <p class="click">Click the image to view this project!</p>
        <p class="description">This project seeks to analyze the employee diversity in some of Silicon Valley’s top tech
          companies. Particularly in the past decade, the fair and equitable representation of all backgrounds and
          identities within some of the most influential companies in the world has been a significant concern. By
          visualizing our two Silicon Valley employee race and gender datasets, we can truly uncover whether or not
          these tech companies are as diverse as they really ought to be. To aid us in our analysis, we derived
          meaningful insights on employee diversity at Silicon Valley’s top ten companies. These ten companies were
          selected by their presence in both the two datasets we used, as we wanted to be able to find ways to overlap
          the two datasets. The datasets used in these visualizations are from
          https://github.com/cirlabs/Silicon-Valley-Diversity-Data and https://data.world/makeovermonday/2018w46.</p>

          for this catalog is stored in a SQLite, production, database. PHP is used to access this data and display it
          on the website in a manner best suited for the target audience of the catalog.</p>

        <p class="description">This project goes through the steps of the human centered design process to develop a
          product specifically addressing and meeting the needs of a target audience. The product being designed is an
          electric grocery cart connected to a mobile app, used to transport people to the grocery store with others.
          This product is designed to meet the needs of the issue of lack of access / transportation to grocery stores
          for college students without cars.</p>
