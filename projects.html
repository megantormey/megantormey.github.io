        <p class="description">These graphs were designed to evaluate changes in streaming services and
          US streaming habits both over time and across platforms. The visualizations were created using d3 and from
          datasets gathered from https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney and
          https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-show.</p>

        <p class="click">Click the image to view this project!</p>
        <p class="description">This project seeks to analyze employee diversity in some of Silicon Valley’s top tech
          companies. In the past decade, fair and equitable representation of all backgrounds and
          identities within some of the most influential companies in the world has been a significant concern. By
          visualizing these two Silicon Valley employee race and gender datasets, we can uncover whether
          these tech companies are truly diverse. To aid in the analysis, we derived
          meaningful insights on employee diversity at Silicon Valley’s top ten companies. These ten companies were
          selected by their presence in both the two datasets we used, as we wanted to be able to find ways to overlap
          the two datasets. The datasets used in these visualizations are from
          https://github.com/cirlabs/Silicon-Valley-Diversity-Data and https://data.world/makeovermonday/2018w46.</p>

        <p class="click">Click the image to view this project!</p>
        <p class="description">This project utilizes the human centered design process to develop a
          product specifically addressing and meeting the needs of the target audience. The product being designed is an
          electric grocery cart connected to a mobile app. The cart is used to transport people to the grocery store
          with their friends and peers. This product is to address the issue of lack of access / transportation to
          grocery stores
          for college students without cars.</p>
