    <div class="contents">
      <h3>Problem Identification:</h3>
      <p>College students lack of access to grocery stores. Specifically, upperclassmen who don't have cars on campus
        have a difficult time acquiring affordable groceries.</p>

      <h3>Objective:</h3>
      <p>To design a product that will ease these students ability to get groceries.</p>

    <h2 class="sec_heading">User Research</h2>
    <div class="contents">
      <h3>User Interview Takeaways:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Students really enjoy and value actually physically being in the grocery store and seeing all of the
          different options in front of them</li>
        <li>Students are really motivated by socializing and social interactions. This fuels both their fun at the
          grocery store and while eating and cooking dinner.</li>
        <li>Going to the grocery store on a set schedule really helps them be able to get to the store consistently,
          even without their own means of transportation.</li>
      </ul>

      <ol>
        <li>Instacart -- Aims to deliver groceries to people who can't or don't want to make it to the grocery store.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>The problem solution is an app / website where you can choose a grocery store in your area and order your
            groceries to be delivered to your home by an Instacart employee.</li>
          <li>One big limitation of this solution is cost. There is a delivery fee associated with Instacart that makes
            getting groceries much more expensive, which is a big limitation for members of our target audience.
            Additionally, there is no real social aspect associated with Instacart, it is solely a transaction.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Anabeles -- Aims to provide affordable and accessible groceries to college students at
          Cornell.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The problem solution is a small, Cornell student run, non-profit, grocery store located near the Cornell
            Law School. They are seeking to provide affordable grocery store options for all Cornell students,
            regardless of year or financial status. Anabels also offers a safe and secure environment, where students
            happen upon each other and can socialize while grocery shopping. Because the store is available just to
            Cornell students, everyone that you run into when you’re there is also a Cornell student</li>
          <li>One limitation of this solution is the limited options. The store is student run, and just located in a
            building on campus. They only have a limited amount of options that they can feasibly provide at one time.
            Thus, students will not be able to rely on this resource for all of their grocery shopping for a week.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Hello Fresh -- Aims to help inexperienced cooks make interesting and inspired
          dinners</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The problem solution is that when you subscribe to a Hello Fresh recipe, they send you a package in the
            mail every week with a few (however many you sign up for) meals for you to make that week. For each meal,
            you get a recipe with instructions for how to prepare the meal, as well as all of the ingredients in the
            proportion that you need for that recipe.</li>
          <li>One limitation of this solution is that it is rather expensive, so it isn't necessarily a sustainable
            solution for the target audience of our product. Additionally, while they send you food and recipes to make
            dinners for a week, this doesn't solve the problem of having food for the other two meals every day.</li>

          <div class="explain">
            <p><b>Explanation:</b> Users will have the checklist app, which they open when they run out of something
              in their fridge or cabinet that they need more of. Then, at the end of the week, the items that are
              checked off in the checklist will be automatically ordered for the user.</p>
            <p><b>Response to Persona's Needs:</b> This responds to Lydia's desire to get new groceries, while not
              having access to a car. Additionally, Lydia is very busy so having the checklist app automatically deliver
              what she needs will save her a lot of time.</p>

              like and comment on their purchases.
            </p>
            <p><b>Response to Persona's Needs:</b> This responds to Lydia's enjoyment of hearing what her friends are
              buying at the store to get inspired with new ideas for ingredients, foods and recipes.</p>

              to a car, so then the whole group will go to the grocery store, get supplies and then make dinner.</p>
            <p><b>Response to Persona's Needs:</b> This responds to Lydia's need to get to the grocery store.
              Additionally, she will be able to meet new people on the app and then have dinner with them so this will

          <div class="explain">
            <p><b>Explanation:</b> Grocery stores will have their own food trucks that they can drive around town.
              While it is just a food truck sized truck, they will have a myriad of different options, just in slightly
              smaller supply. People can just walk up to the truck, order the groceries that they want, and then the
              truck can move to a new location if it needs to get more business.</p>
            <p><b>Response to Persona's Needs:</b> This responds to Lydia's need for groceries, without a car to drive
              all the way to the full grocery store. Additionally, the cost of upkeep for a food truck is relatively
              low, so the truck wouldn't have to up-charge the items, thus responding to Lydia's need for affordable
              groceries.</p>

    <h2 class="sec_heading">Prototyping and User Testing</h2>
    <div class="contents">
      <h3>Low fidelity prototype</h3>
      <video class="vid" controls="controls" />

      <source src="images/low_fi_prototype.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video>
      <h3>User Testing</h3>
      <p>After creating the paper prototype of the super shopper delivery cart app, we conducted user testing. We asked
        users to complete tasks such as booking a grocery delivery and booking a shopping trip with a friend. Here are
        some of the findings from these tests:</p>
      <h4>Findings:</h4>
      <p>One new thing that I learned about the participant is that she was trying to go through the whole process
        faster than I was anticipating. By this I mean that she took much less time to ponder different options, or
        consider what she thought something meant or what she should input into a form for instance. While some of this
        could be just disinterest in pretending with a paper prototype, this is still interesting information that
        should be factored into the design. Users won't take a long time to consider what to do, they want / need for it
        to be very obvious.
      </p>
      <p>The user has a positive response to a few aspects of the design. One was the activity page. She both seemed to
        like it, and was able to quickly figure out and navigate through this page. She liked the amount of information
        displayed about each trip and the means through which it was displayed. Another aspect of the design that she
        had a positive response to were the confirmation screens. She liked that the app gave a confirmation that the
        information went through and a quick recap of what she input.</p>
      <p>The user also had some negative reactions to the design. She didn't like the way the app had her input the
        ingredients into the auto shopper order. She described it as tedious and a waste of time. Additionally, she had
        some difficulty understanding what all of the buttons were (i.e., the “+” button) and what the icons on the
        navigation bar represented.</p>
      <p>Based on the user feedback and some of my own observations through the feedback process, there are a few
        changes I plan on making to the design. One big thing is the “+” button that appears in the bottom right of each
        page. Initially, I thought this was a good idea because it provides some standardization across the whole site
        and is similar to other apps I have seen. However, the actual function of this button was very unclear to the
        user and caused more harm than good. I plan to remove this button as its functionality is also able to be
        completed elsewhere in the design. Another change I plan to make is either changing the menu bar icons, or even
        switching to words. While the icons are fun and I thought informative, they are not standardized enough that the
        user knows what the different icons represent. Thus, changing them will help the user more easily navigate the
        site.</p>

      <source src="images/hi_fid_prototype_overview.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video>
      <h3>User Testing</h3>
      <p>After completing the higher fidelity prototype, we conducted user testing again on the new prototype. Again, we
        asked the users to complete the same tasks as with the first prototype and evaluated their performances and
        reactions on how they improved their feelings of effectiveness, satisfaction and social connectedness. Here are
        some of the findings:</p>
      <h4>Findings:</h4>
      <div class="eval">
        <div class="measure effective">
          <div>Effectiveness: 4/5</div>

              stroke-dasharray="calc(20 * 31.4 / 100) 31.4" transform="rotate(-90) translate(-20)" />
          </svg>
        </div>
        <div class="measure">
          <div>Satisfaction: 7.5/10</div>
          <svg height="100" width="100" viewBox="0 0 20 20">
            <circle r="10" cx="10" cy="10" fill="white" />
            <circle r="5" cx="10" cy="10" fill="green" stroke="white" stroke-width="10"
              stroke-dasharray="calc(25 * 31.4 / 100) 31.4" transform="rotate(-90) translate(-20)" />
          </svg>
        </div>
        <div class="measure social">
          <div>Social Connectedness: 6.5/10</div>
          <div class="pichart">
            <svg height="100" width="100" viewBox="0 0 20 20">
              <circle r="10" cx="10" cy="10" fill="white" />
              <circle r="5" cx="10" cy="10" fill="green" stroke="white" stroke-width="10"
                stroke-dasharray="calc(35 * 31.4 / 100) 31.4" transform="rotate(-90) translate(-20)" />
            </svg>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>User testing revealed that on average, the users were able to effectively complete 80% of the tasks.
        Additionally, users reported being 75% satisfied with the app and gave it a 6.5 / 10 for how much it improved
        their social connectedness. After evaluating user performance and where they were facing difficulties and
        dissatisfaction with the app, we made some iterations to the prototype.</p>
