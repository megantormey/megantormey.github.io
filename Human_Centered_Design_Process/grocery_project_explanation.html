    <div class="contents">
      <h3>User Interview Takeaways:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Students really enjoy and value actually physically being in the grocery store and seeing all of the
          different options in front of them</li>
        <li>Students are really motivated by socializing and social interactions. This fuels both their fun at the
          grocery store and while eating and cooking dinner.</li>
        <li>Going to the grocery store on a set schedule really helps them be able to get to the store consistently,
          even without their own means of transportation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
      <p>Following the user interviews, we used Figma to create an affinity diagram to find commonalities and patterns
        between the different user interviews conducted. Click <a href="hci_affinity_diagram.html"
          class="alink">here</a> to view
        these diagrams.</p>
