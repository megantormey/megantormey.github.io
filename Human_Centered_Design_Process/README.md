# Grocery Shopping App (Human Centered Design Process)

This project goes through the steps of the human centered design process to develop a product specifically addressing and meeting the needs of a target audience.  The product being designed is an electric grocery cart connected to a mobile app, used to transport people to the grocery store with others.  This product is designed to meet the needs of the issue of lack of access / transportation to grocery stores for college students without cars.
