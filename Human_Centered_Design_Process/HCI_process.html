<h1>Human Computer Interaction Project</h1>

<h3>Part 1: Developing Project Idea</h3>

<h4>Lack of access to grocery stores.</h4>
<ol>
  <li>User group: Upperclassmen who live off-campus, don't have a car, want to save money, and don’t like to eat out
    all the time.</li>
  <li>Problem Space: Meals and nourishment is a sizable living expense we all face. Without easy access to the
    grocery
    store, this cost goes up immensely with the only option to be dining out. Thus, the problem facing this user
    group
    is the lack of access to affordable groceries. Without a car, the time cost is a crucial concern for our user
    group when doing groceries. Public transportation usually costs two to three times more time and considerable
    physical work to carry heavy bags. The current online solution to this problem can be very pricey.
  </li>
  <li>Enthusiasm: We are excited about helping this group because accessibility to affordable groceries for healthy
    living is an important issue, especially among younger people. This project will give members of the user group
    access to more affordable groceries. Thus, one impact of this project is saving money and alleviating one source
    of financial strain for those within our user group. Additionally, a second potential impact of the project’s
    results is to increase the variety of meal options available to the individuals in this user group and thus
    improving their general nutrition, and ultimately their health.

<h3>Part 2: Conduct User Interviews: Better Understand Problem Space</h3>

<h4>User Interviews:</h4>

<p>The first step in the process of running the user interviews was to create an interview protocol to follow in all of
  the user interviews. Below is some information and takeaways from one of the completed user interviews.</p>

<p>Participant:</p>
<p>Sarah is a senior at Cornell studying Human Development in the College of Human Ecology. This semester she is
  enrolled in 13 credits. She lives in a house in Collegetown with 6 other roommates. In the house, there is one kitchen
  with one stove, one oven, one dishwasher and two refrigerators. She doesn’t have a car in Ithaca, or means of
  transportation of her own. Additionally, she cooks many meals for herself per week.</p>

<p>Context of the Interview</p>
<p>The interview occurred in the kitchen of the participant’s home. It was conducted at 6PM on Wednesday October 6th.
  The interview lasted around 30 minutes. The interview was conducted in the kitchen of the participant’s home. The
  kitchen is attached to the living room of the home in a relatively open floor plan. Whilst conducting the interview,
  there was a lot of hustle and bustle around the kitchen and living room. The participant has six other roommates, 5 of
  whom were in the area at the time of the interview. During the course of the interview, there were two people in the
  kitchen cooking their dinner. This involved cutting veggies, using the oven and sauteing things on the stove.</p>

<p>Session Summary Takeaways</p>
<ul>
  <li>One really interesting and important thing that I learned from this interview and from this participant is that
    one aspect of the grocery shopping process that she really enjoys and values is actually physically being in the
    grocery store. This is slightly counter to what I would have imagined to be the case.</li>
  <li>Sarah is really motivated by socializing and social interactions. This fuels both her fun at the grocery store and
    while eating and cooking dinner.</li>
  <li>Going to the grocery store on a set schedule really helps Sarah be able to get to the store consistently, even
    without her own means of transportation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Following the user interviews, we used Figma to create an affinity diagram to find commonalities and patterns between
  the different user interviews conducted. Below is the affinity diagram.</p>

<h3>Step 3. Develop Persona</h3>

<p>Lydia is currently a senior at Cornell University and this is her seventh semester of college. She is enrolled in 23
  credits this semester. Her indecisive nature caused her to not declare her major until the end of her sophomore year,
  so her course load has to be very full for the remainder of her semesters in order to graduate on time. After much
  debate over a major, she landed on psychology. This mostly stemmed from her dislike of math; she chose the major as
  far from anything math related that she could find. This dislike of math has expanded in her life past just her choice
  of major. It also plays a role in her finances. While she tries to be careful with her spending, she doesn’t keep any
  sort of budget or record of what she has spent or how much she will spend going forward. She knows this may seem
  reckless or careless, but it has worked out for her so far. Lydia grew up in Southern California, a place that is warm
  and sunny. The first few winters after moving to Ithaca were a real shock to the system, and the snow was very
  unusual. While she can drive around no problem at home, the snowy hills in Ithaca are too intimidating to drive around
  on. As such, Lydia doesn’t have a car of her own in Ithaca, and has no interest in getting one.</p>

<p>One of Lydia’s main sources of happiness is through connection and friendships with her peers and those around her.
  She cares a lot about building strong bonds with the people around her and making these bonds ones that will last. She
  really enjoys spending time with her friends and socializing over meals. On the weekends, this often means eating take
  out or at a restaurant. However, always eating out isn’t an entirely sustainable lifestyle, especially because Lydia
  cares a lot about maintaining good health. So, while she often eats out on the weekends, Lydia also enjoys eating
  healthy, home cooked meals filled with lots of good nutrition. Sometimes she cooks these meals just for herself, other
  times she’ll cook with her friends. She has found that this balance of eating out versus cooking has helped her to
  maintain being healthy over the course of her life, and this is something she would like to continue.</p>

<p>Sometimes Lydia struggles with the balance between keeping up with work and good grades and spending time socializing
  with her friends. She cares greatly about her grades and doing well in school. However, sometimes she has trouble
  finding time to hang out with her friends and partake in social activities because she always finds herself doing
  work. But this is a balance she is making strides to improve upon. One area that she tries to get back sometime that
  is filled by her busy class schedule is by not spending too much time cooking on weeknights. Sometimes this means meal
  prepping at the beginning of the week, while other times this means cooking quick and easy meals. Going to the gym on
  a somewhat regular basis is another goal that Lydia has for her already busy schedule. She is able to get to the gym
  on campus some days after her classes, but ideally she would be in the gym more regularly. While she is trying to
  exercise in the gym, she doesn’t want to have to exert herself too much when she isn’t actively working out in the
  gym. She doesn’t like her backpack to be too heavy while she is walking around campus, carrying heavy loads when she
  goes shopping (specifically grocery shopping), etc..</p>

<p>Since Lydia doesn’t have her own car in Ithaca, she relies on her friends and roommates to drive her places. The main
  destination that she has to make it to regularly is the grocery store. She really enjoys eating meals with her friends
  when she has the chance. Either going out to dinner, getting takeout or making a meal with friends and roommates is
  Lydia’s idea of a perfect social gathering. This is mostly only able to happen on the weekends though, because of
  everyone’s busy schedule. Most recently, Lydia spent a few hours with one of her friends reproducing a famous BBQ lamb
  recipe from Gorden Ramsay, which was enjoyed by friends. In addition to having dinner parties on the weekends, Lydia
  sees it as a success when she meal preps on Sunday to make dinners for the coming weekdays. While she likes to be
  prepared and do things like meal prep, one thing she doesn’t have control over is when she can get rides with her
  roommates. This causes her some frustration because the only time that she is able to get a ride to the grocery store
  is on Sunday mornings when the store is at its busiest. She gets stressed by all of the people hustling and bustling
  around her. However, she still prefers this option to getting her groceries delivered. She has only tried that a few
  times, but each time the groceries have been delayed, and she wasn’t able to get any adventurous or fun new foods.</p>

<h3>Step 4. Develop Project Requirements</h3>

<h4>Functional Requirements:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Social Interaction</li>
  <li>Time Management</li>
  <li>Shopping Recommendations</li>
  <li>Coordinate Grocery Shopping Trip</li>
  <li>Preferred Store</li>
</ol>
<h4>Contextual Requirements</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Physical Strength</li>
  <li>Mobile Application</li>
  <li>All Day Access</li>
  <li>Not Similar to Instacart</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 5. Investigate the Solution Space</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Instacart</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Name: Instacart</li>
    <li>The problem this solution targets is lack of access / transportation to groceries and grocery stores.</li>
    <li>The problem solution is an app / website where you can choose a grocery store in your area and order your
      groceries to be delivered to your home by an Instacart employee.</li>
    <li>One big limitation of this solution is cost. There is a delivery fee associated with Instacart that makes
      getting groceries much more expensive, which is a big limitation for members of our target audience. Additionally,
      there is no real social aspect associated with Instacart, it is solely a transaction.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Anabeles</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Name: Anabeles</li>
    <li>The problem this solution targets is providing affordable and accessible groceries to college students at
      Cornell.</li>
    <li>The problem solution is a small, Cornell student run, non-profit, grocery store located near the Cornell Law
      School. They are seeking to provide affordable grocery store options for all Cornell students, regardless of year
      or financial status. Anabels also offers a safe and secure environment, where students happen upon each other and
      can socialize while grocery shopping. Because the store is available just to Cornell students, everyone that you
      run into when you’re there is also a Cornell student</li>
    <li>One limitation of this solution is the limited options. The store is student run, and just located in a building
      on campus. They only have a limited amount of options that they can feasibly provide at one time. Thus, students
      will not be able to rely on this resource for all of their grocery shopping for a week.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Hello Fresh</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Name: Hello Fresh</li>
    <li>The problem that this solution targets is helping inexperienced cooks make interesting and inspired dinners.
    </li>
    <li>The problem solution is that when you subscribe to a Hello Fresh recipe, they send you a package in the mail
      every week with a few (however many you sign up for) meals for you to make that week. For each meal, you get a
      recipe with instructions for how to prepare the meal, as well as all of the ingredients in the proportion that you
      need for that recipe.</li>
    <li>One limitation of this solution is that it is rather expensive, so it isn’t necessarily a sustainable solution
      for the target audience of our product. Additionally, while they send you food and recipes to make dinners for a
      week, this doesn’t solve the problem of having food for the other two meals every day.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Grocery Curb-Side Pickup</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Name: Grocery Curb-Side Pickup</li>
    <li>The problem that this solution targets is shoppers not wanting to have to spend time and energy in the crowded
      grocery store.</li>
    <li>The problem solution is a function where grocery shoppers can go on the store website ahead of time, choose the
      groceries that they would like to purchase and then just pick the groceries up outside of the store. While they
      still have to make the trip to the store, the whole shopping process when using this method is much quicker.</li>
    <li>One limitation of this solution is that the people using this option still have to find transportation to the
      grocery store, which is a real limitation for the users in our target group.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
